Chrome extension to check timezones (Final project for cs50x course)

Video Demo: Clock.ly Demo Description: Clockly is a chrome extension that helps users to check the time in different timezones easily. It uses the chrome extension manifest V3. It works by checking the timezone of the user then converting it to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Each timezone has an offset from the Coordinated Universal Time. These offsets are declared as constants. A function called getDate takes an offset as a parameter. It calculates the UTC from the users current time using the Date method. Now the offset is added to the UTC. Now to get the the timezone of lets say, Eastern standard time, the offset of Eastern Standard Time is passed into the getDate function which calculates the date by adding the offset to the UTC. The results is returned and stored in a variable. The variable now contains a date object. Using the getHours, getMinutes and getSeconds functions of the date object, we are able to get the time of that timezone. We then send it to the front end by using the innerHTML funtion to publish the time into a div. There is one more file which is the manifest.json file. This contains the basic configurations of a chrome extension such as title, version, description and other required by the chrome extension Manifest V3. That is all for the description of my project.
